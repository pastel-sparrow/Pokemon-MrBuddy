# International Pokémon Regions #

There is a YouTube series by Mr Buddy called "What If ... Was A Pokémon Region?"

This GitHub is to connect all of the ideas and help create new games as a fan creations.

The engine for this project will be made under a different (non open) licence and will not be hosted here on GitHub.

However I will attempt to port these as GB/GBC/GBA/DS ROMs and will be **free to download** and the downloads will be released under an open licence (later will be decided which licence)
